## Form Submission and API Integration App

This is a simple application built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose for the backend. The app receives data from a form on forms.app, processes the data through a webhook, and sends it to 123FormBuilder via API.

- Backend:
